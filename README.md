## Layout

This is a Yarn workspaces monorepo:

- `/server` — Nest.js API (TypeScript), Prisma against Postgres.
- `/frontend` — React app (TypeScript), Vite.
- `docker-compose.yml` — Redis and Postgres only. The server and frontend are **not** dockerized; they run locally against this infra.

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies once, from the repo root:

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

2. Run the app. This starts the Docker infra (Postgres and Redis) and the API and frontend together:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   Or run just one, from the repo root: `yarn workspace server run dev` / `yarn workspace frontend run dev`.

3. Apply database migrations (first time, and whenever the schema changes):

   ```sh
   yarn migrate:db
   ```
